# Sundae Designer

A simple react app for designing and ordering sundaes.

## Project Overview

This project was created based on a [_Udemy course_](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/), but with many enhancements in terms of technology and architecture. It was built using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and focuses on functional testing, which tests behavior instead of implementation.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Redux Toolkit
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Mock Service Worker
- React-Bootstrap

## Setup
1. Clone this repo to your desktop
2. Open the project directory in your terminal
3. In the `client` directory, run the following commands:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
4. In the `server` directory, run the following commands:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

And that's it! The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
